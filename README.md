<h2 style="text-align:center;">Application Overview</h2>
  <p>A game featuring cast a little pixel egg that you'll play as. The goal of the game is to get your egg 
    across the run where it'll face different obstacle to get to the end.
    Very similar to the old mario games or flappy bird games.

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Technology Overview</h2>
<p>I plan to use java as I haven't spent much time with python. But that might change in the future. I don't which platforms or libraries I plan to use it.
