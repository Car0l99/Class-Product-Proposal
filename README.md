<h2 style="text-align:center;">Application Overview</h2>
  <p>A game featuring cast of 6 litle egg pixel characters, each with their own accessories.
    That provide a defining difference between them. The goal of the game is to get your egg 
    across the 3 levels which are to mimick the old Mario games where mario runs across a field of
    obstacles and monsters to get to the next level.
  </p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Technology Overview</h2>
<p>I plan to use python, as java is a nightmare. I don't which platforms or libraries I plan to use it.
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Date Proposal Last updated</h2>
<p>November 3, 2023</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Feature List</h2>
<p>6 different monsters across the 3 levels (2 for each). For example,
  a pufferfish that shoots out bubble beams that cause damage. Along with the
  Eggs being able to jump, dodge, run and duck & obstacles like tree stumps.
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Future Feature List</h2>
<p>Powerups that eggs can utilize to get past the monsters.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Basic Technical Features</h2>
<p>
  I plan to use most of the python that we used in class for this game.
